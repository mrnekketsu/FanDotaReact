FanDota was my mod 4 project during my time at Flatiron School. This is the repo for frontend side of this project.

##  Motivations

I’ve been playing Dota 2 after watching The International 2 back in 2012. While I don’t have much time to play these days, I’ve followed the competitive scene for a while now. It goes without saying that I’m a pretty big fan! With that in mind, I decided to put into practice the React skills that I learned at Flatiron School during mod 4 and built this project.

Two challenges included:
+ Having the front end dynamically display whether a user is following a team or not while having those updates in the backend persist through the join table between teams and their followers
+ Integrate JSON Web tokens so that the back end could encrypt and decrypt data that is held in the local storage of the browser


## Under the Hood Stuff

This project was built using React. Some of the data was pulled from the [Open Dota API](https://docs.opendota.com/), which is a great API to look at all sorts of data related to the game.
